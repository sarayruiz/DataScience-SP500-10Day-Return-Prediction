# 📈 S&P 500 10-Day Return Prediction

This project consists of developing a machine learning model to predict whether a stock in the S&P 500 index will increase its price by at least 1% over the next 10 trading days. Historical data and technical market indicators are used to identify patterns that anticipate short-term positive price movements.

Multiple machine learning models were tested, including Gradient and Random Forest, which were selected as the final models for optimization and deployment in a web application using Streamlit. This application allows the user to choose between both models to make real-time predictions.

## 🎯 Project Goal

Create a binary classification model that indicates whether a stock will have a positive return greater than or equal to 1% in the next 10 days, based on technical indicators, volume, volatility, and adjusted historical data.

---

## 📊 Data Description

The data used comes from the "Advanced Stock Dataset" available on Kaggle, built with historical information from the Yahoo Finance API for S&P 500 companies over approximately the last five years.

The dataset contains over 620,000 daily records and 73 features, including adjusted prices, technical indicators such as moving averages, RSI, MACD, volatility, and lagged variables to capture temporal dynamics. The target variable is binary and represents whether the cumulative return over the next 10 days exceeds 1%.

## 🚀 Methodology

1. **Data Exploration and Analysis:**  
   Thorough analysis of dataset features and variables to understand their behavior.

2. **Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:**  
   Cleaning and creating technical and lagged variables to capture temporal patterns.

3. **Model Training and Optimization:**  
   Multiple supervised models were trained, selecting XGBoost and Random Forest as the most effective.

4. **Results Evaluation:**  
   Validation using classification metrics and comparative analysis between models.

5. **Deployment:**  
   Development of a Streamlit web application that allows users to select a model and predict returns.
